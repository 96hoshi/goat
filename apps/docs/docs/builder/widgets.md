# Widgets

Widgets are the **building blocks** of your dashboard. They allow you to display various types of data and information in a visually appealing way. Each widget can be costumized to fit your needs, whether you want to show numbers, charts, or project elements like text and images.

## How to use the Widgets

You can edit in the **Builder** mode...

Drag the chosen widget from the right sidebar to any panel. Do not worry, you can **rearrange**, **remove** or **edit** them any time.

The widget of the visible layers appear by default on the sidebar.

By simply clicking on the panel, you can open the **panel settings**, and you can personalize the appearance of the wigets and the panel itself.

You can set the **panel style** as *default*...

At the **appearance** you can change the widget's *opacity*, *add *background blur*, and *shadow*.

In the **Position** set the *Align items* and the *spacing*.

At the bottom you can delete the panel completely.

## Information

### Layers

Add the legends of the layers to your dashboard and filter which ones you want to show.

## Data

### Filter

If you add this widget, the viewers can use this as a filter, more like a cropping tool on the map - this is very similar to our "filter" tool in the Data mode. 

filter viewport - dynamic filter
"expression" works the same way as in QGIS
cross filter - synhronises the number with the filtered layer

### Numbers

Choose from different statistic methods to be done on the layer. 

The format of the number is dynamic based on the language.

## Charts

### Categories

similar to "numbers", but works more as like "grouping" and is also dynamic

### Histogram

Works only for number fields.

### Pie chart

Another view of the categories basically.

## Project Elements

The 4th section acts like a design section for your panels.

### Text

floating text editor

### Divider

### Image
