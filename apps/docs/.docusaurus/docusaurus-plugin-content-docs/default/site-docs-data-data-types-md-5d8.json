  "description": "GOAT handles a wide range of geometry types for spatial data. This capability is achieved by using a PostgreSQL database enhanced with the PostGIS extension. GOAT stores all geometries in the PostGIS geometry type (PostGIS geometry type is a way to store and work with various shapes and locations on a map within a PostgreSQL database. It allows you to keep details about points (such as landmarks), lines (such as roads), and areas (such as districts) directly in your database) within the EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system. However, for operations involving length or area measurements, the PostGIS geography type is used. This type allows calculations in meters and offers higher accuracy.",
