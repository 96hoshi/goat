### 1.Copy geojson files in the next folder
### 2.Check and update name lookup conditions
Go to the goat config.yaml folder located in the path:
```
\app\config\goat_config.yaml

Look the line: "pois_sear_conditions"
Each line is an amenity brand, create one new line for each custom_pois to be updated, delete those that you do not need.
